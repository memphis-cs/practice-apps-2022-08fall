  description: 'Used to perform Transorbital Lobotomy. Here is your chance to have a Lobotomy tool set. An orbitoclast is a surgical instrument used for performing transorbital lobotomies. It was invented by Dr. Walter Freeman in 1948 to replace the unique form of leucotome used up until that point for the transorbital lobotomy procedure. The hammer and Orbitoclast are made out of stainless steel. The orbitoclast is stamped Freeman on both sides. This is a replica and not to be confused from an original. This set is for a collection or display purposes only! The orbitoclast is pointed and is very dangerous. I will not be held liable for the misuse of any product gotten from me. Must be 21 and older for these item',
